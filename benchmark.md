When I ran a test case with ~1 million lines with n=2 my program had the following stats:
memory consumed (kb): 206851.48
run time (s): 1048.576
run time (min): 17.48

When I ran the v11 file (the 12gb one) with n = 3, I got the following stats:
memory consumed(kb):  406496.94
run time (s): 3276.8
run time (min): 54.613335

When I ran the program with the 1 million line test case, my average stats were:
memory consumed (kb): ~210000
run time (s): ~960-1080
run time (min): ~16-18

When I ran the program with the v11 (12gb) test case, my average stats were:
memory consumed (kb): ~410000
run time (s): ~3300-3600
run time (min): ~55-60
